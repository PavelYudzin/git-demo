		Heartbreaker

Careful where you stand now boy
Everything has changed
Got to search and destroy
Everything has changed
Got to move stop the dreams
All protection gone
Listen how the people scream
On and on and on

Time to get away from here
You won't see me shed a tear
No time to say goodbye
Danger in the dead of night
Takes away the strength to fight
All we know is black despair
Heartbreaker
